## Get Started

Follow these steps to instrument your first LLM application with Anyway.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Account">
    Sign up at [webapp.anyway.sh](https://webapp.anyway.sh) and create your first project.

    Once logged in, navigate to **Developer** > **API Keys** and create a new SDK API key.

    <Warning>
      Keep your API key secure. Never commit it to version control.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the Anyway Python SDK using pip (requires Python 3.10+):

    ```bash
    pip install anyway-sdk
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    Initialize Traceloop in your application with your API key:

    ```python
    from anyway.sdk import Traceloop

    Traceloop.init(
        app_name="my-app",
        api_endpoint="collector.anyway.sh:4317",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key"}
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Tracing">
    The SDK automatically instruments LLM calls from OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers.

    For custom workflow tracing with `@workflow` and `@task` decorators, see [Tracing LLM Calls](/sdk/tracing).
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Your Traces">
    Open the [Anyway Dashboard](https://webapp.anyway.sh) and navigate to **Traces**.

    You'll see your workflow and task spans with:
    - Execution hierarchy (workflow → tasks)
    - Duration and timing for each operation
    - Request and response data
    - Token usage and cost estimates

    Click on any trace to see the full span tree.
  </Step>
</Steps>
