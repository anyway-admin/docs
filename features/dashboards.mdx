Deep dive into latency and performance:
- P50, P90, P99 latency by model
- Latency trends over time
- Slow requests table
- Throughput (requests per minute)

### Cost Dashboard

Financial insights:
- Daily/weekly/monthly spend
- Cost breakdown by model
- Cost by user attribute
- Budget vs actual

    Time series data (latency trends, request volume)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bar Chart" icon="chart-bar">
    Categorical comparisons (cost by model, requests by user)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stat" icon="hashtag">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Table" icon="table">
    Detailed data (recent traces, top users)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pie Chart" icon="chart-pie">

```yaml
type: table
metric: llm.cost.total
groupBy: user_id
aggregation: sum
orderBy: desc
limit: 10
timeRange: 30d
```

## Sharing Dashboards

Share dashboards with your team:

filters:
  environment: $environment
```

## Scheduling Reports

Schedule dashboard snapshots:

1. Open dashboard settings
2. Click **Schedule Report**
3. Configure:
   - Frequency (daily, weekly)
   - Recipients (email)
   - Time zone
4. Save
