## Overview

The Anyway REST API allows you to programmatically access your telemetry data, manage projects, and configure your account.

**Base URL:**
```
https://api.anyway.sh/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token.

### Getting an API Key

1. Log in to your [Dashboard](https://webapp.anyway.sh)
2. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Create New Key**
4. Copy your key (it won't be shown again)

### Using the API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.anyway.sh/v1/traces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Request Format

- All requests should use HTTPS
- Request bodies should be JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`
- Timestamps are in ISO 8601 format (UTC)

## Response Format

All responses are JSON with the following structure:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_abc123",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "The request body is malformed",
    "details": {}
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_abc123",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited based on your plan:

| Plan | Rate Limit |
|------|------------|
| Free | 100 requests/minute |
| Pro | 1,000 requests/minute |
| Enterprise | Custom |

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1705315800
```

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Pagination

List endpoints return paginated results:

```bash
curl "https://api.anyway.sh/v1/traces?limit=50&cursor=abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response includes pagination info:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 50,
    "has_more": true,
    "next_cursor": "xyz789"
  }
}
```

## SDKs

For most use cases, we recommend using the Python SDK instead of the REST API directly:

```python
pip install anyway-sdk
```

The SDK handles authentication, retries, and error handling automatically.
