## Plan Limits

Each plan has the following limits:

| Resource | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
|----------|------|-----|------------|
| Traces/month | 10,000 | 100,000 | Unlimited |
| Data retention | 7 days | 30 days | Custom |
| Projects | 1 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Team members | 1 | 10 | Unlimited |
| API rate limit | 100/min | 1,000/min | Custom |
| Dashboards | 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Alerts | 3 | 20 | Unlimited |

## Checking Your Usage

View current usage in the dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Usage**
2. See current period usage:
   - Traces sent
   - Percentage of limit used
   - Days remaining in period

Or via API:

```bash
curl https://api.anyway.sh/v1/usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "plan": "pro",
  "period": {
    "start": "2024-01-01",
    "end": "2024-01-31"
  },
  "traces": {
    "used": 45000,
    "limit": 100000,
    "percentage": 45
  }
}
```

## What Happens When You Hit Limits

### Trace Limits

When you reach your trace limit:

1. **Warning at 80%** - Email notification
2. **Warning at 100%** - Dashboard notification
3. **At limit** - New traces are still accepted but:
   - Free: Oldest traces are dropped
   - Pro: Overage charges apply ($0.50/1,000 traces)
   - Enterprise: No overage (unlimited)

<Warning>
  On the Free plan, exceeding limits will cause data loss. Upgrade to Pro to avoid this.
</Warning>

### API Rate Limits

When you exceed API rate limits:

- Requests return `429 Too Many Requests`
- Retry after the period shown in `Retry-After` header
- Consider implementing exponential backoff

```python
import time
import anyway

try:
    anyway.send_trace(trace)
except anyway.RateLimitError as e:
    time.sleep(e.retry_after)
    anyway.send_trace(trace)  # Retry
```

## Increasing Limits

### Upgrade Your Plan

The easiest way to increase limits is to upgrade:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**
2. Click **Change Plan**
3. Select a higher tier

### Request Custom Limits

Enterprise customers can request custom limits:

- Higher API rate limits
- Extended data retention
- Increased team member limits

## Optimizing Usage

### Reduce Trace Volume

If you're approaching limits, consider:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sample traces" icon="filter">
    Don't trace every request in production:
    ```python
    anyway.init(sample_rate=0.1)  # 10% sampling
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Filter by importance" icon="star">
    Only trace important operations:
    ```python
    anyway.init(
        trace_filter=lambda span: span.latency > 1000  # Only slow requests
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use environments" icon="layer-group">
    Only trace production, not development:
    ```python
    anyway.init(
        enabled=os.getenv("ENV") == "production"
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Reduce Data Size

Smaller traces use less quota:

- Avoid tracing large payloads
- Use `max_payload_size` configuration
- Exclude sensitive/unnecessary fields

## Usage Alerts

Set up alerts to avoid surprise limits:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Alerts**
2. Create a usage alert:
   - Trigger at 50%, 80%, 90% usage
   - Notify via email or Slack

## Usage History

View historical usage:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Usage**
2. Select date range
3. View daily/weekly/monthly breakdown

Export usage data for reporting:

```bash
curl "https://api.anyway.sh/v1/usage/history?start=2024-01-01&end=2024-01-31" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
