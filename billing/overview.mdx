## What Counts as a Trace?

A **trace** represents one logical operation, which may contain multiple spans. For example:

```
1 trace = user-request
├── span: validate-input
├── span: openai.chat.completions (LLM call)
├── span: process-response
└── span: save-to-db
```

This entire operation counts as **1 trace**, not 4.

## Usage-Based Pricing

For high-volume users, we offer usage-based pricing:

| Traces/month | Price per 1,000 traces |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Up to 100K | $0.50 |
| 100K - 1M | $0.40 |
| 1M - 10M | $0.30 |
